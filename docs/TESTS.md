## ASTHMA
### Tests
> Your doctor may use several tests to determine how well your lungs are working.
>
#### Spirometry
> This is the main test doctors generally use to diagnose asthma in people 5 years or older.
> To help determine how well your lungs are working (pulmonary function), you take a deep breath and forcefully breathe out (exhale) into a tube connected to a spirometer. This records both the amount (volume) of air you exhale and how quickly you exhale. If certain measurements are below normal for a person your age, it may indicate that asthma has narrowed your airways.
>
>
#### Challenge test
> If your spirometer results are normal or near normal, your doctor might try to trigger asthma symptoms by having you inhale a substance that causes the airways to narrow in people with asthma, such as methacholine (meth-uh-KO-leen).
> If you appear to have asthma triggered by exercise (exercise-induced asthma), you may be asked to do physical activity to see whether it triggers symptoms.
> After either action, you'll retake the spirometry test. If your spirometry measurements remain normal, you probably don't have asthma. But if your measurements have fallen significantly, it's possible you do.

#### Lung tests in children
> Doctors seldom do lung tests in children under age 5. Instead, diagnosis is generally based on a child's signs and symptoms, medical history, and physical examination. It can be especially difficult to diagnose asthma in young children because there are many conditions that cause asthma-like symptoms in this age group.
> If your child's doctor suspects asthma, the doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator — a drug that opens the airways. If your child's signs and symptoms improve after using the bronchodilator, your child may have asthma.

#### Exhaled nitric oxide test
>You breathe into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of nitric oxide gas in your breath. Nitric oxide gas is produced by the body normally, but high levels in your breath can mean your airways are inflamed — a sign of asthma.
>
>
### Additional tests: Ruling out conditions other than asthma
>If your doctor suspects that you have a condition in addition to or other than asthma, you may need tests such as:
+ X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) imaging of your chest
+ CT scans of your sinuses
+ Blood tests
+ Gastroesophageal reflux assessment
+ Examination of the phlegm in your lungs (sputum induction and examination) for signs of a viral or bacterial infection



## Diabetes
### Tests for Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, and Prediabetes
>
>Your doctor will have you take one or more of the following blood tests to confirm the diagnosis:
>
#### A1C Test
>The A1C test measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2 or 3 months. An A1C below 5.7% is normal, between 5.7 and 6.4% indicates you have prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates you have diabetes.
>
>
#### Fasting Blood Sugar Test
>This measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating). A fasting blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.
>
>
#### Glucose Tolerance Test
>This measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward. At 2 hours, a blood sugar level of 140 mg/dL or lower is considered normal, 140 to 199 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.
>
>
#### Random Blood Sugar Test
>This measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You can take this test at any time and don’t need to fast (not eat) first. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.
>
>
### Tests for Gestational Diabetes
>
>Gestational diabetes is diagnosed using blood tests. You’ll probably be tested between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If your risk is higher for getting gestational diabetes (due to having more risk factors), your doctor may test you earlier. Blood sugar that’s higher than normal early in your pregnancy may indicate you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes rather than gestational diabetes.
>
#### Glucose Screening Test
>This measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You’ll drink a liquid that contains glucose, and then 1 hour later your blood will be drawn to check your blood sugar level. A normal result is 140 mg/dL or lower. If your level is higher than 140 mg/dL, you’ll need to take a glucose tolerance test.

#### Glucose Tolerance Test
>This measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward. Results can differ depending on the size of the glucose drink and how often your blood sugar is tested. Ask your doctor what your test results mean.
