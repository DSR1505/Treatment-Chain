## What are the parameters a patient is tested for COVID-19 ##

   >There are three types of tests:
    + PCR Test ( Most accurate) Duration: Several Minutes to several days.
    + Antigen Test (Not as accurate compartively to PCR Test) Duration: Upto 15 minutes
    + Antibody Test (Doesn't tell whether you are immune to infection or not) Duration: Upto several days.
    >Since the PCR Test is most accurate we go with the PCR Test which means we only consider patient that gone through the PCR Test.
    Following is the result of RT-PCR Test:
    35 cycles of real-time test happens that release 35 billions of DNA strands copies. Each copy realeses some fluorescent dye. The amount
    is recorded in each cycle. When amount of fluorescent dye crosses certain threshold confirms the presence of virus.
    **Conclusion: Record the amount of flourscent dye in 35 cycles for each patient went through RT-PCR Test.**
